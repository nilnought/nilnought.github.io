# Which suburb(s) to buy an investment property in Canberra witin your budget

There are more than 80 suburbs in Canberra and most of the propery inspections are on Saturdays. So when you are looking for an investment property to buy you might want to know which suburb is worth the time to look at. This post shows how we identify which surburb(s) to buy within your budget. It only examines the detached houses as we think that land which is the limited resource will become more valuable. 

## Grouping suburbs

Since there are so many suburbs. Why not group them first and see which ones are similar? We fed <a href="https://dbr.abs.gov.au/region.html?lyr=sa2&rgn=801011001">ABS income and employment industry data from year 2015 to year 2019</a> into the Fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering method and grouped all the suburbs into 12 assignments (1-12) with the assignment 0 containing all the suburbs that are unable to be grouped.

For example, it seems that Aranda, O'Connor, Ainslie, Reid, Campbell, Barton, Griffith, Narrabundah, Garran, Hughes, Curtin, Isaacs and Chapman are similar in terms of income and employment industries.
After having an idea of the grouping of the suburbs then comes the next question, with my budget which suburb(s) can I afford?  

## Within your budget?

The chart below shows you the possibility of buying a house within your budget, based on all the past sales from January 2023 to September 2023.The darker the color the higher chance of affording a house. If a suburb is not shown, that means there has not been a sale within that price range. You can slide the budget range at the bottom from $800k to $1.8m.

If you were thinking to pay $1.2m, you could either wait longer until the house within your budget shows up in a more expensive suburb like Cambpell or choose a similar but cheaper suburb like Aranda.
