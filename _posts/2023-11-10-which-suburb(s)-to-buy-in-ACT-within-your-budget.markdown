# Which suburb(s) to buy an investment property in Canberra witin your budget

There are more than 80 suburbs in Canberra and most of the propery inspections are on Saturdays. So when you are looking for an investment property to buy you might want to know which suburb is worth the time to look at. This post shows how we identify which surburb(s) to buy within your budget. It only examines the detached houses as we think that land which is the limited resource will become more valuable. 

## Grouping suburbs

Since there are so many suburbs. Why not we group them first and see which ones are similar? We fed 2019 ABS data into the algorism and group all the suburbs based on income and employment. reason, the richer get richer.

The suburbs are grouped by colors.
We then grouped the suburbs based on the growth rates from 1999 to 2023. the reason, max growth

These two ways of grouping Canberran suburbs give you a clear picture which suburbs are similar. Then comes the next question, with my budget which suburb(s) can I afford?  

## Within your budget?

Let's say your budget is $1.2m. The picture below shows you the possibility of buying a house within this budget, based on all the past sales since January 2021, assuming that the propery prices will not drop below the level of 2021.

Now, you could either wait longer until the house within your budget shows up in a more expensive suburb like Cambpell or choose one from a larger pool in a similar but cheaper suburb like Aranda.
