# What is the right price to pay for a house you are interested in

The previous post on 10 Nov 2023 shows how you find out the suburb(s) in Canberra within your budget you will focus on. This post will approach the estimation of a house price from two angles, aiming to address the question of how much one should pay for a house of interest. 

## Sale price distribution

One way to look at whether you are paying too much for a house is to examine the price distribution of the recent sales. If the house is better than the average in the suburb but you paid less than the median price, congratulations, you likely made a good deal. The chart below illustrates the price distribution of recent sales[^1] between January and September 2023 in Canberra's suburbs. For example, the most houses sold (4) in Florey for the period is within the price range between $1m and 1.1m. And the cheapest houses sold are around $900,000 and there are only 2 of them. You can hover the mouse on the chart for more statistics.

## Unimproved value (UV)

Another method of valuing a house is by adding a margin for the building based on the land's unimproved value. The unimproved value is what the block of land is worth and does not include any improvements on the land, such as buildings, landscape gardening, paths and fences. A higher house margin (difference between the sale price of a house and its UV) may be attributed by various factors such as a nicer house, a greater popularity of a suburb or just a stronger property market. A negative margin indicates that the sale price is less than the UV. The chart below displays the distribution of the house margins of the recent sales[^1] between Janurary and September 2023 for the suburbs in Canberra. For instance, in Kambah, most houses (16) were sold during the period with a margin between $300,000 and $400,000 above their corresponding UVs. The lowest house margin is between $100,000 and $200,000 and there are only 2 houses sold in that range.

## Example
Hypothetically, you paid $850,000 for the house 14 Traine Court in Amaroo. Referring to the chart of the sale price distribution, this price is at the lower end, considering that most houses were sold for amounts exceeding the range of $900,000 to $1m. The block's UV in the year 2023 is $502,000 and the house margin you added is around $350,000 which falls within the second lowest house margin range ($300,000 - $400,000) for the suburb according to the chart of the house margin distribution. Therefore, if this 3 beds-2 baths-2 garages house with a block size of 429m2 was in better condition than the average house in the suburb, as per your past inspections, you likely got a bargain.
